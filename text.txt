I spent a year and a half through programs with America On Tech, learning my 
first coding languages of web development coding. Because of this program, I 
have spent countless hours coding to practice and learn more about coding.  
Here are some projects that I have coded in web development.

During my time learning web development coding, I also had the opportunity to 
learn React as part of the America On Tech, programming class, to help prepare 
me for my internship they gave me with the James Jay Dudley Luce Foundation. 

In my free time, I like to spend time learning new things that interest me,
one of them being different coding languages. These are all the projects that
I have coded in Python.

For one of my Computer Science classes, we took the time to explore our choice
of coding languages. My group chose to explore PHP. This is the project we created 
as a group in our time learning PHP. I hope to take this knowledge and expand it on 
my future web development projects.

As a Computer Science major, we have learned to program in the language
Java, here are some projects that I have done with it, both in school and 
in my free time.

In one of the many Computer Science classes I have taken, students formed
groups of 5 or less, in order to create projects to practice the idea of 
software development. My group decided to use Unity, and C# to create a 
Rougelite Game. 

As a Computer Science major, we have learned to program in the language
C++, here are some projects that I have done with it, both in school and 
in my free time.
